    question: "Who owns the code and intellectual property after launch?",
    answer: "You do. 100%. Once the final invoice is settled, the complete codebase, assets, and intellectual property are transferred to you. We don't hold your asset hostage like traditional retain-and-drain agencies."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you use pre-made ThemeForest or WordPress templates?",
    answer: "Absolutely not. Even if we build on a CMS for your convenience, the entire front-end and architecture are bespoke-engineered from a blank canvas. We build for speed, security, and your specific business logic."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a bespoke Next.js or SaaS build take?",
    answer: "A standard high-performance web application typically takes 4 to 8 weeks. Complex multi-tenant SaaS platforms or native mobile apps range from 8 to 16 weeks. We map out the exact timeline during our technical discovery phase."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you maintain the software after deployment?",
    answer: "Yes. While you own the code, we offer dedicated scaling and maintenance retainers to our development partners. This ensures your infrastructure is always updated, secure, and running at peak performance."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I work with an account manager or developers?",
    answer: "You work directly with the senior software architects building your product. We eliminate the 'middle-man' account managers so nothing gets lost in translation between your vision and our code."
